### Hey 👋🏼

I'm Scheilla Azevedo, a UI / UX designer passionate about web development. 

Currently I dedicate myself to "get projects off the drawing board", from entrepreneurs who seek the development of a digital product, normally aimed at the financial sector.

Here you will find my studies, in the form of projects with Javascript and Vue.js technologies, which I do in my spare time.✨
